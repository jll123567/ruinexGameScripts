# Ruinex Game Scripts
The scripts from a game I made in roblox. Along with the place file.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
destoryGUIOnAccept.lua --Pretty simple.

ruinexBaseInst.lua --Script that makes the magic happen. Each player gets one instance of this script each. Serverside.

ruinexBaseScript.lua --The base script by Salvo_Starly. OG paste here: https://pastebin.com/raw/S298DJmF

ruinexClient.lua --The clientside script for passing events to the server.

ruinexMgnt.lua --Handles specific events like the player dying.

ruinexPlace.rbxl --The place in its entirety.
